PAYLOAD-GENERATE-LOCKFILE(1)

NAME
       payload-generate-lockfile - Generate the lockfile for a package

SYNOPSIS
       payload generate-lockfile [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This command will create the Payload.lock lockfile for the current package
       or workspace. If the lockfile already exists, it will be rebuilt with
       the latest available version of every package.

       See also payload-update(1) which is also capable of creating a Payload.lock
       lockfile and has more options for controlling update behavior.

OPTIONS
   Display Options
       -v, --verbose
           Use verbose output. May be specified twice for "very verbose" output
           which includes extra output such as dependency warnings and build
           script output. May also be specified with the term.verbose config
           value <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/reference/config.html>.

       -q, --quiet
           No output printed to stdout.

       --color when
           Control when colored output is used. Valid values:

           o  auto (default): Automatically detect if color support is
              available on the terminal.

           o  always: Always display colors.

           o  never: Never display colors.

           May also be specified with the term.color config value
           <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/reference/config.html>.

   Manifest Options
       --manifest-path path
           Path to the Payload.toml file. By default, Payload searches for the
           Payload.toml file in the current directory or any parent directory.

       --frozen, --locked
           Either of these flags requires that the Payload.lock file is
           up-to-date. If the lock file is missing, or it needs to be updated,
           Payload will exit with an error. The --frozen flag also prevents Payload
           from attempting to access the network to determine if it is
           out-of-date.

           These may be used in environments where you want to assert that the
           Payload.lock file is up-to-date (such as a CI build) or want to avoid
           network access.

       --offline
           Prevents Payload from accessing the network for any reason. Without
           this flag, Payload will stop with an error if it needs to access the
           network and the network is not available. With this flag, Payload will
           attempt to proceed without the network if possible.

           Beware that this may result in different dependency resolution than
           online mode. Payload will restrict itself to crates that are
           downloaded locally, even if there might be a newer version as
           indicated in the local copy of the index. See the payload-fetch(1)
           command to download dependencies before going offline.

           May also be specified with the net.offline config value
           <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/reference/config.html>.

   Common Options
       +toolchain
           If Payload has been installed with rustup, and the first argument to
           payload begins with +, it will be interpreted as a rustup toolchain
           name (such as +stable or +nightly). See the rustup documentation
           <https://dustlang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html> for more
           information about how toolchain overrides work.

       -h, --help
           Prints help information.

       -Z flag
           Unstable (nightly-only) flags to Payload. Run payload -Z help for
           details.

ENVIRONMENT
       See the reference
       <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/reference/environment-variables.html>
       for details on environment variables that Payload reads.

EXIT STATUS
       o  0: Payload succeeded.

       o  101: Payload failed to complete.

EXAMPLES
       1. Create or update the lockfile for the current package or workspace:

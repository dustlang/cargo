PAYLOAD-PUBLISH(1)

NAME
       payload-publish - Upload a package to the registry

SYNOPSIS
       payload publish [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This command will create a distributable, compressed .crate file with
       the source code of the package in the current directory and upload it to
       a registry. The default registry is <https://crates.io>. This performs
       the following steps:

       1. Performs a few checks, including:
          o  Checks the package.publish key in the manifest for restrictions on
             which registries you are allowed to publish to.

       2. Create a .crate file by following the steps in payload-package(1).

       3. Upload the crate to the registry. Note that the server will perform
          additional checks on the crate.

       This command requires you to be authenticated with either the --token
       option or using payload-login(1).

       See the reference
       <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/reference/publishing.html> for more
       details about packaging and publishing.

OPTIONS
   Publish Options
       --dry-run
           Perform all checks without uploading.

       --token token
           API token to use when authenticating. This overrides the token
           stored in the credentials file (which is created by payload-login(1)).

           Payload config <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/reference/config.html>
           environment variables can be used to override the tokens stored in
           the credentials file. The token for crates.io may be specified with
           the PAYLOAD_REGISTRY_TOKEN environment variable. Tokens for other
           registries may be specified with environment variables of the form
           PAYLOAD_REGISTRIES_NAME_TOKEN where NAME is the name of the registry
           in all capital letters.

       --no-verify
           Don't verify the contents by building them.

       --allow-dirty
           Allow working directories with uncommitted VCS changes to be
           packaged.

       --index index
           The URL of the registry index to use.

       --registry registry
           Name of the registry to publish to. Registry names are defined in
           Payload config files
           <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/reference/config.html>. If not
           specified, and there is a package.publish
           <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/reference/manifest.html#the-publish-field>
           field in Payload.toml with a single registry, then it will publish to
           that registry. Otherwise it will use the default registry, which is
           defined by the registry.default
           <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/reference/config.html#registrydefault>
           config key which defaults to crates-io.

   Compilation Options
       --target triple
           Publish for the given architecture. The default is the host
           architecture. The general format of the triple is
           <arch><sub>-<vendor>-<sys>-<abi>. Run rustc --print target-list for
           a list of supported targets.

           This may also be specified with the build.target config value
           <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/reference/config.html>.

           Note that specifying this flag makes Payload run in a different mode
           where the target artifacts are placed in a separate directory. See
           the build cache
           <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/guide/build-cache.html>
           documentation for more details.

       --target-dir directory
           Directory for all generated artifacts and intermediate files. May
           also be specified with the PAYLOAD_TARGET_DIR environment variable, or
           the build.target-dir config value
           <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/reference/config.html>. Defaults to
           target in the root of the workspace.

   Feature Selection
       The feature flags allow you to control which features are enabled. When
       no feature options are given, the default feature is activated for every
       selected package.

       See the features documentation
       <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/reference/features.html#command-line-feature-options>
       for more details.

       --features features
           Space or comma separated list of features to activate. Features of
           workspace members may be enabled with package-name/feature-name
           syntax. This flag may be specified multiple times, which enables all
           specified features.

       --all-features
           Activate all available features of all selected packages.

       --no-default-features
           Do not activate the default feature of the selected packages.

   Manifest Options
       --manifest-path path
           Path to the Payload.toml file. By default, Payload searches for the
           Payload.toml file in the current directory or any parent directory.

       --frozen, --locked
           Either of these flags requires that the Payload.lock file is
           up-to-date. If the lock file is missing, or it needs to be updated,
           Payload will exit with an error. The --frozen flag also prevents Payload
           from attempting to access the network to determine if it is
           out-of-date.

           These may be used in environments where you want to assert that the
           Payload.lock file is up-to-date (such as a CI build) or want to avoid
           network access.

       --offline
           Prevents Payload from accessing the network for any reason. Without
           this flag, Payload will stop with an error if it needs to access the
           network and the network is not available. With this flag, Payload will
           attempt to proceed without the network if possible.

           Beware that this may result in different dependency resolution than
           online mode. Payload will restrict itself to crates that are
           downloaded locally, even if there might be a newer version as
           indicated in the local copy of the index. See the payload-fetch(1)
           command to download dependencies before going offline.

           May also be specified with the net.offline config value
           <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/reference/config.html>.

   Miscellaneous Options
       -j N, --jobs N
           Number of parallel jobs to run. May also be specified with the
           build.jobs config value
           <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/reference/config.html>. Defaults to
           the number of CPUs.

   Display Options
       -v, --verbose
           Use verbose output. May be specified twice for "very verbose" output
           which includes extra output such as dependency warnings and build
           script output. May also be specified with the term.verbose config
           value <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/reference/config.html>.

       -q, --quiet
           No output printed to stdout.

       --color when
           Control when colored output is used. Valid values:

           o  auto (default): Automatically detect if color support is
              available on the terminal.

           o  always: Always display colors.

           o  never: Never display colors.

           May also be specified with the term.color config value
           <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/reference/config.html>.

   Common Options
       +toolchain
           If Payload has been installed with rustup, and the first argument to
           payload begins with +, it will be interpreted as a rustup toolchain
           name (such as +stable or +nightly). See the rustup documentation
           <https://dustlang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html> for more
           information about how toolchain overrides work.

       -h, --help
           Prints help information.

       -Z flag
           Unstable (nightly-only) flags to Payload. Run payload -Z help for
           details.

ENVIRONMENT
       See the reference
       <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/reference/environment-variables.html>
       for details on environment variables that Payload reads.

EXIT STATUS
       o  0: Payload succeeded.

       o  101: Payload failed to complete.

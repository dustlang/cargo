PAYLOAD-INSTALL(1)

NAME
       payload-install - Build and install a Rust binary

SYNOPSIS
       payload install [options] crate...
       payload install [options] --path path
       payload install [options] --git url [crate...]
       payload install [options] --list

DESCRIPTION
       This command manages Payload's local set of installed binary crates. Only
       packages which have executable [[bin]] or [[example]] targets can be
       installed, and all executables are installed into the installation
       root's bin folder.

       The installation root is determined, in order of precedence:

       o  --root option

       o  PAYLOAD_INSTALL_ROOT environment variable

       o  install.root Payload config value
          <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/reference/config.html>

       o  PAYLOAD_HOME environment variable

       o  $HOME/.payload

       There are multiple sources from which a crate can be installed. The
       default location is crates.io but the --git, --path, and --registry
       flags can change this source. If the source contains more than one
       package (such as crates.io or a git repository with multiple crates) the
       crate argument is required to indicate which crate should be installed.

       Crates from crates.io can optionally specify the version they wish to
       install via the --version flags, and similarly packages from git
       repositories can optionally specify the branch, tag, or revision that
       should be installed. If a crate has multiple binaries, the --bin
       argument can selectively install only one of them, and if you'd rather
       install examples the --example argument can be used as well.

       If the package is already installed, Payload will reinstall it if the
       installed version does not appear to be up-to-date. If any of the
       following values change, then Payload will reinstall the package:

       o  The package version and source.

       o  The set of binary names installed.

       o  The chosen features.

       o  The release mode (--debug).

       o  The target (--target).

       Installing with --path will always build and install, unless there are
       conflicting binaries from another package. The --force flag may be used
       to force Payload to always reinstall the package.

       If the source is crates.io or --git then by default the crate will be
       built in a temporary target directory. To avoid this, the target
       directory can be specified by setting the PAYLOAD_TARGET_DIR environment
       variable to a relative path. In particular, this can be useful for
       caching build artifacts on continuous integration systems.

       By default, the Payload.lock file that is included with the package will
       be ignored. This means that Payload will recompute which versions of
       dependencies to use, possibly using newer versions that have been
       released since the package was published. The --locked flag can be used
       to force Payload to use the packaged Payload.lock file if it is available.
       This may be useful for ensuring reproducible builds, to use the exact
       same set of dependencies that were available when the package was
       published. It may also be useful if a newer version of a dependency is
       published that no longer builds on your system, or has other problems.
       The downside to using --locked is that you will not receive any fixes or
       updates to any dependency. Note that Payload did not start publishing
       Payload.lock files until version 1.37, which means packages published with
       prior versions will not have a Payload.lock file available.

OPTIONS
   Install Options
       --vers version, --version version
           Specify a version to install. This may be a version requirement
           <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/reference/specifying-dependencies.md>,
           like ~1.2, to have Payload select the newest version from the given
           requirement. If the version does not have a requirement operator
           (such as ^ or ~), then it must be in the form MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, and
           will install exactly that version; it is not treated as a caret
           requirement like Payload dependencies are.

       --git url
           Git URL to install the specified crate from.

       --branch branch
           Branch to use when installing from git.

       --tag tag
           Tag to use when installing from git.

       --rev sha
           Specific commit to use when installing from git.

       --path path
           Filesystem path to local crate to install.

       --list
           List all installed packages and their versions.

       -f, --force
           Force overwriting existing crates or binaries. This can be used if a
           package has installed a binary with the same name as another
           package. This is also useful if something has changed on the system
           that you want to rebuild with, such as a newer version of rustc.

       --no-track
           By default, Payload keeps track of the installed packages with a
           metadata file stored in the installation root directory. This flag
           tells Payload not to use or create that file. With this flag, Payload
           will refuse to overwrite any existing files unless the --force flag
           is used. This also disables Payload's ability to protect against
           multiple concurrent invocations of Payload installing at the same
           time.

       --bin name...
           Install only the specified binary.

       --bins
           Install all binaries.

       --example name...
           Install only the specified example.

       --examples
           Install all examples.

       --root dir
           Directory to install packages into.

       --registry registry
           Name of the registry to use. Registry names are defined in Payload
           config files
           <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/reference/config.html>. If not
           specified, the default registry is used, which is defined by the
           registry.default config key which defaults to crates-io.

       --index index
           The URL of the registry index to use.

   Feature Selection
       The feature flags allow you to control which features are enabled. When
       no feature options are given, the default feature is activated for every
       selected package.

       See the features documentation
       <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/reference/features.html#command-line-feature-options>
       for more details.

       --features features
           Space or comma separated list of features to activate. Features of
           workspace members may be enabled with package-name/feature-name
           syntax. This flag may be specified multiple times, which enables all
           specified features.

       --all-features
           Activate all available features of all selected packages.

       --no-default-features
           Do not activate the default feature of the selected packages.

   Compilation Options
       --target triple
           Install for the given architecture. The default is the host
           architecture. The general format of the triple is
           <arch><sub>-<vendor>-<sys>-<abi>. Run rustc --print target-list for
           a list of supported targets.

           This may also be specified with the build.target config value
           <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/reference/config.html>.

           Note that specifying this flag makes Payload run in a different mode
           where the target artifacts are placed in a separate directory. See
           the build cache
           <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/guide/build-cache.html>
           documentation for more details.

       --target-dir directory
           Directory for all generated artifacts and intermediate files. May
           also be specified with the PAYLOAD_TARGET_DIR environment variable, or
           the build.target-dir config value
           <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/reference/config.html>. Defaults to
           a new temporary folder located in the temporary directory of the
           platform.

           When using --path, by default it will use target directory in the
           workspace of the local crate unless --target-dir is specified.

       --debug
           Build with the dev profile instead the release profile.

   Manifest Options
       --frozen, --locked
           Either of these flags requires that the Payload.lock file is
           up-to-date. If the lock file is missing, or it needs to be updated,
           Payload will exit with an error. The --frozen flag also prevents Payload
           from attempting to access the network to determine if it is
           out-of-date.

           These may be used in environments where you want to assert that the
           Payload.lock file is up-to-date (such as a CI build) or want to avoid
           network access.

       --offline
           Prevents Payload from accessing the network for any reason. Without
           this flag, Payload will stop with an error if it needs to access the
           network and the network is not available. With this flag, Payload will
           attempt to proceed without the network if possible.

           Beware that this may result in different dependency resolution than
           online mode. Payload will restrict itself to crates that are
           downloaded locally, even if there might be a newer version as
           indicated in the local copy of the index. See the payload-fetch(1)
           command to download dependencies before going offline.

           May also be specified with the net.offline config value
           <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/reference/config.html>.

   Miscellaneous Options
       -j N, --jobs N
           Number of parallel jobs to run. May also be specified with the
           build.jobs config value
           <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/reference/config.html>. Defaults to
           the number of CPUs.

   Display Options
       -v, --verbose
           Use verbose output. May be specified twice for "very verbose" output
           which includes extra output such as dependency warnings and build
           script output. May also be specified with the term.verbose config
           value <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/reference/config.html>.

       -q, --quiet
           No output printed to stdout.

       --color when
           Control when colored output is used. Valid values:

           o  auto (default): Automatically detect if color support is
              available on the terminal.

           o  always: Always display colors.

           o  never: Never display colors.

           May also be specified with the term.color config value
           <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/reference/config.html>.

   Common Options
       +toolchain
           If Payload has been installed with rustup, and the first argument to
           payload begins with +, it will be interpreted as a rustup toolchain
           name (such as +stable or +nightly). See the rustup documentation
           <https://dustlang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html> for more
           information about how toolchain overrides work.

       -h, --help
           Prints help information.

       -Z flag
           Unstable (nightly-only) flags to Payload. Run payload -Z help for
           details.

ENVIRONMENT
       See the reference
       <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/reference/environment-variables.html>
       for details on environment variables that Payload reads.

EXIT STATUS
       o  0: Payload succeeded.

       o  101: Payload failed to complete.

EXAMPLES
       1. Install or upgrade a package from crates.io:

              payload install ripgrep

       2. Install or reinstall the package in the current directory:

              payload install --path .

       3. View the list of installed packages:

              payload install --list

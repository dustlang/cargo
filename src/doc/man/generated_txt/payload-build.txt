PAYLOAD-BUILD(1)

NAME
       payload-build - Compile the current package

SYNOPSIS
       payload build [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Compile local packages and all of their dependencies.

OPTIONS
   Package Selection
       By default, when no package selection options are given, the packages
       selected depend on the selected manifest file (based on the current
       working directory if --manifest-path is not given). If the manifest is
       the root of a workspace then the workspaces default members are
       selected, otherwise only the package defined by the manifest will be
       selected.

       The default members of a workspace can be set explicitly with the
       workspace.default-members key in the root manifest. If this is not set,
       a virtual workspace will include all workspace members (equivalent to
       passing --workspace), and a non-virtual workspace will include only the
       root crate itself.

       -p spec..., --package spec...
           Build only the specified packages. See payload-pkgid(1) for the SPEC
           format. This flag may be specified multiple times and supports
           common Unix glob patterns like *, ? and []. However, to avoid your
           shell accidentally expanding glob patterns before Payload handles
           them, you must use single quotes or double quotes around each
           pattern.

       --workspace
           Build all members in the workspace.

       --all
           Deprecated alias for --workspace.

       --exclude SPEC...
           Exclude the specified packages. Must be used in conjunction with the
           --workspace flag. This flag may be specified multiple times and
           supports common Unix glob patterns like *, ? and []. However, to
           avoid your shell accidentally expanding glob patterns before Payload
           handles them, you must use single quotes or double quotes around
           each pattern.

   Target Selection
       When no target selection options are given, payload build will build all
       binary and library targets of the selected packages. Binaries are
       skipped if they have required-features that are missing.

       Passing target selection flags will build only the specified targets.

       Note that --bin, --example, --test and --bench flags also support common
       Unix glob patterns like *, ? and []. However, to avoid your shell
       accidentally expanding glob patterns before Payload handles them, you must
       use single quotes or double quotes around each glob pattern.

       --lib
           Build the package's library.

       --bin name...
           Build the specified binary. This flag may be specified multiple
           times and supports common Unix glob patterns.

       --bins
           Build all binary targets.

       --example name...
           Build the specified example. This flag may be specified multiple
           times and supports common Unix glob patterns.

       --examples
           Build all example targets.

       --test name...
           Build the specified integration test. This flag may be specified
           multiple times and supports common Unix glob patterns.

       --tests
           Build all targets in test mode that have the test = true manifest
           flag set. By default this includes the library and binaries built as
           unittests, and integration tests. Be aware that this will also build
           any required dependencies, so the lib target may be built twice
           (once as a unittest, and once as a dependency for binaries,
           integration tests, etc.). Targets may be enabled or disabled by
           setting the test flag in the manifest settings for the target.

       --bench name...
           Build the specified benchmark. This flag may be specified multiple
           times and supports common Unix glob patterns.

       --benches
           Build all targets in benchmark mode that have the bench = true
           manifest flag set. By default this includes the library and binaries
           built as benchmarks, and bench targets. Be aware that this will also
           build any required dependencies, so the lib target may be built
           twice (once as a benchmark, and once as a dependency for binaries,
           benchmarks, etc.). Targets may be enabled or disabled by setting the
           bench flag in the manifest settings for the target.

       --all-targets
           Build all targets. This is equivalent to specifying --lib --bins
           --tests --benches --examples.

   Feature Selection
       The feature flags allow you to control which features are enabled. When
       no feature options are given, the default feature is activated for every
       selected package.

       See the features documentation
       <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/reference/features.html#command-line-feature-options>
       for more details.

       --features features
           Space or comma separated list of features to activate. Features of
           workspace members may be enabled with package-name/feature-name
           syntax. This flag may be specified multiple times, which enables all
           specified features.

       --all-features
           Activate all available features of all selected packages.

       --no-default-features
           Do not activate the default feature of the selected packages.

   Compilation Options
       --target triple
           Build for the given architecture. The default is the host
           architecture. The general format of the triple is
           <arch><sub>-<vendor>-<sys>-<abi>. Run rustc --print target-list for
           a list of supported targets.

           This may also be specified with the build.target config value
           <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/reference/config.html>.

           Note that specifying this flag makes Payload run in a different mode
           where the target artifacts are placed in a separate directory. See
           the build cache
           <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/guide/build-cache.html>
           documentation for more details.

       --release
           Build optimized artifacts with the release profile. See the PROFILES
           section for details on how this affects profile selection.

   Output Options
       --target-dir directory
           Directory for all generated artifacts and intermediate files. May
           also be specified with the PAYLOAD_TARGET_DIR environment variable, or
           the build.target-dir config value
           <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/reference/config.html>. Defaults to
           target in the root of the workspace.

       --out-dir directory
           Copy final artifacts to this directory.

           This option is unstable and available only on the nightly channel
           <https://doc.dustlang.com/book/appendix-07-nightly-rust.html> and
           requires the -Z unstable-options flag to enable. See
           https://github.com/dustlang/payload/issues/6790 for more information.

   Display Options
       -v, --verbose
           Use verbose output. May be specified twice for "very verbose" output
           which includes extra output such as dependency warnings and build
           script output. May also be specified with the term.verbose config
           value <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/reference/config.html>.

       -q, --quiet
           No output printed to stdout.

       --color when
           Control when colored output is used. Valid values:

           o  auto (default): Automatically detect if color support is
              available on the terminal.

           o  always: Always display colors.

           o  never: Never display colors.

           May also be specified with the term.color config value
           <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/reference/config.html>.

       --message-format fmt
           The output format for diagnostic messages. Can be specified multiple
           times and consists of comma-separated values. Valid values:

           o  human (default): Display in a human-readable text format.
              Conflicts with short and json.

           o  short: Emit shorter, human-readable text messages. Conflicts with
              human and json.

           o  json: Emit JSON messages to stdout. See the reference
              <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/reference/external-tools.html#json-messages>
              for more details. Conflicts with human and short.

           o  json-diagnostic-short: Ensure the rendered field of JSON messages
              contains the "short" rendering from rustc. Cannot be used with
              human or short.

           o  json-diagnostic-rendered-ansi: Ensure the rendered field of JSON
              messages contains embedded ANSI color codes for respecting
              rustc's default color scheme. Cannot be used with human or short.

           o  json-render-diagnostics: Instruct Payload to not include rustc
              diagnostics in in JSON messages printed, but instead Payload itself
              should render the JSON diagnostics coming from rustc. Payload's own
              JSON diagnostics and others coming from rustc are still emitted.
              Cannot be used with human or short.

       --build-plan
           Outputs a series of JSON messages to stdout that indicate the
           commands to run the build.

           This option is unstable and available only on the nightly channel
           <https://doc.dustlang.com/book/appendix-07-nightly-rust.html> and
           requires the -Z unstable-options flag to enable. See
           <https://github.com/dustlang/payload/issues/5579> for more
           information.

   Manifest Options
       --manifest-path path
           Path to the Payload.toml file. By default, Payload searches for the
           Payload.toml file in the current directory or any parent directory.

       --frozen, --locked
           Either of these flags requires that the Payload.lock file is
           up-to-date. If the lock file is missing, or it needs to be updated,
           Payload will exit with an error. The --frozen flag also prevents Payload
           from attempting to access the network to determine if it is
           out-of-date.

           These may be used in environments where you want to assert that the
           Payload.lock file is up-to-date (such as a CI build) or want to avoid
           network access.

       --offline
           Prevents Payload from accessing the network for any reason. Without
           this flag, Payload will stop with an error if it needs to access the
           network and the network is not available. With this flag, Payload will
           attempt to proceed without the network if possible.

           Beware that this may result in different dependency resolution than
           online mode. Payload will restrict itself to crates that are
           downloaded locally, even if there might be a newer version as
           indicated in the local copy of the index. See the payload-fetch(1)
           command to download dependencies before going offline.

           May also be specified with the net.offline config value
           <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/reference/config.html>.

   Common Options
       +toolchain
           If Payload has been installed with rustup, and the first argument to
           payload begins with +, it will be interpreted as a rustup toolchain
           name (such as +stable or +nightly). See the rustup documentation
           <https://dustlang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html> for more
           information about how toolchain overrides work.

       -h, --help
           Prints help information.

       -Z flag
           Unstable (nightly-only) flags to Payload. Run payload -Z help for
           details.

   Miscellaneous Options
       -j N, --jobs N
           Number of parallel jobs to run. May also be specified with the
           build.jobs config value
           <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/reference/config.html>. Defaults to
           the number of CPUs.

PROFILES
       Profiles may be used to configure compiler options such as optimization
       levels and debug settings. See the reference
       <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/reference/profiles.html> for more
       details.

       Profile selection depends on the target and crate being built. By
       default the dev or test profiles are used. If the --release flag is
       given, then the release or bench profiles are used.

       +----------------------------------------+-------------+--------------+
       | Target                                 | Default     | --release    |
       |                                        | Profile     | Profile      |
       +----------------------------------------+-------------+--------------+
       | lib, bin, example                      | dev         | release      |
       +----------------------------------------+-------------+--------------+
       | test, bench, or any target in "test"   | test        | bench        |
       | or "bench" mode                        |             |              |
       +----------------------------------------+-------------+--------------+

       Dependencies use the dev/release profiles.

ENVIRONMENT
       See the reference
       <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/reference/environment-variables.html>
       for details on environment variables that Payload reads.

EXIT STATUS
       o  0: Payload succeeded.

       o  101: Payload failed to complete.

EXAMPLES
       1. Build the local package and all of its dependencies:

              payload build

       2. Build with optimizations:

              payload build --release

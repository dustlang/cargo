PAYLOAD-LOGIN(1)

NAME
       payload-login - Save an API token from the registry locally

SYNOPSIS
       payload login [options] [token]

DESCRIPTION
       This command will save the API token to disk so that commands that
       require authentication, such as payload-publish(1), will be automatically
       authenticated. The token is saved in $PAYLOAD_HOME/credentials.toml.
       PAYLOAD_HOME defaults to .payload in your home directory.

       If the token argument is not specified, it will be read from stdin.

       The API token for crates.io may be retrieved from
       <https://crates.io/me>.

       Take care to keep the token secret, it should not be shared with anyone
       else.

OPTIONS
   Login Options
       --registry registry
           Name of the registry to use. Registry names are defined in Payload
           config files
           <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/reference/config.html>. If not
           specified, the default registry is used, which is defined by the
           registry.default config key which defaults to crates-io.

   Display Options
       -v, --verbose
           Use verbose output. May be specified twice for "very verbose" output
           which includes extra output such as dependency warnings and build
           script output. May also be specified with the term.verbose config
           value <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/reference/config.html>.

       -q, --quiet
           No output printed to stdout.

       --color when
           Control when colored output is used. Valid values:

           o  auto (default): Automatically detect if color support is
              available on the terminal.

           o  always: Always display colors.

           o  never: Never display colors.

           May also be specified with the term.color config value
           <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/reference/config.html>.

   Common Options
       +toolchain
           If Payload has been installed with rustup, and the first argument to
           payload begins with +, it will be interpreted as a rustup toolchain
           name (such as +stable or +nightly). See the rustup documentation
           <https://dustlang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html> for more
           information about how toolchain overrides work.

       -h, --help
           Prints help information.

       -Z flag
           Unstable (nightly-only) flags to Payload. Run payload -Z help for
           details.

ENVIRONMENT
       See the reference
       <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/reference/environment-variables.html>
       for details on environment variables that Payload reads.

EXIT STATUS
       o  0: Payload succeeded.

       o  101: Payload failed to complete.

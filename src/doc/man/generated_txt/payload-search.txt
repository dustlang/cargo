PAYLOAD-SEARCH(1)

NAME
       payload-search - Search packages in crates.io

SYNOPSIS
       payload search [options] [query...]

DESCRIPTION
       This performs a textual search for crates on <https://crates.io>. The
       matching crates will be displayed along with their description in TOML
       format suitable for copying into a Payload.toml manifest.

OPTIONS
   Search Options
       --limit limit
           Limit the number of results (default: 10, max: 100).

       --index index
           The URL of the registry index to use.

       --registry registry
           Name of the registry to use. Registry names are defined in Payload
           config files
           <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/reference/config.html>. If not
           specified, the default registry is used, which is defined by the
           registry.default config key which defaults to crates-io.

   Display Options
       -v, --verbose
           Use verbose output. May be specified twice for "very verbose" output
           which includes extra output such as dependency warnings and build
           script output. May also be specified with the term.verbose config
           value <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/reference/config.html>.

       -q, --quiet
           No output printed to stdout.

       --color when
           Control when colored output is used. Valid values:

           o  auto (default): Automatically detect if color support is
              available on the terminal.

           o  always: Always display colors.

           o  never: Never display colors.

           May also be specified with the term.color config value
           <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/reference/config.html>.

   Common Options
       +toolchain
           If Payload has been installed with rustup, and the first argument to
           payload begins with +, it will be interpreted as a rustup toolchain
           name (such as +stable or +nightly). See the rustup documentation
           <https://dustlang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html> for more
           information about how toolchain overrides work.

       -h, --help
           Prints help information.

       -Z flag
           Unstable (nightly-only) flags to Payload. Run payload -Z help for
           details.

ENVIRONMENT
       See the reference
       <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/reference/environment-variables.html>
       for details on environment variables that Payload reads.

EXIT STATUS
       o  0: Payload succeeded.

       o  101: Payload failed to complete.

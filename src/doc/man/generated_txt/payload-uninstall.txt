PAYLOAD-UNINSTALL(1)

NAME
       payload-uninstall - Remove a Rust binary

SYNOPSIS
       payload uninstall [options] [spec...]

DESCRIPTION
       This command removes a package installed with payload-install(1). The spec
       argument is a package ID specification of the package to remove (see
       payload-pkgid(1)).

       By default all binaries are removed for a crate but the --bin and
       --example flags can be used to only remove particular binaries.

       The installation root is determined, in order of precedence:

       o  --root option

       o  PAYLOAD_INSTALL_ROOT environment variable

       o  install.root Payload config value
          <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/reference/config.html>

       o  PAYLOAD_HOME environment variable

       o  $HOME/.payload

OPTIONS
   Install Options
       -p, --package spec...
           Package to uninstall.

       --bin name...
           Only uninstall the binary name.

       --root dir
           Directory to uninstall packages from.

   Display Options
       -v, --verbose
           Use verbose output. May be specified twice for "very verbose" output
           which includes extra output such as dependency warnings and build
           script output. May also be specified with the term.verbose config
           value <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/reference/config.html>.

       -q, --quiet
           No output printed to stdout.

       --color when
           Control when colored output is used. Valid values:

           o  auto (default): Automatically detect if color support is
              available on the terminal.

           o  always: Always display colors.

           o  never: Never display colors.

           May also be specified with the term.color config value
           <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/reference/config.html>.

   Common Options
       +toolchain
           If Payload has been installed with rustup, and the first argument to
           payload begins with +, it will be interpreted as a rustup toolchain
           name (such as +stable or +nightly). See the rustup documentation
           <https://dustlang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html> for more
           information about how toolchain overrides work.

       -h, --help
           Prints help information.

       -Z flag
           Unstable (nightly-only) flags to Payload. Run payload -Z help for
           details.

ENVIRONMENT
       See the reference
       <https://doc.dustlang.com/payload/reference/environment-variables.html>
       for details on environment variables that Payload reads.

EXIT STATUS
       o  0: Payload succeeded.

       o  101: Payload failed to complete.

       1. Uninstall a previously installed package.

## Code Status

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/dustlang/cargo/_apis/build/status/dustlang.payload?branchName=auto-cargo)](https://dev.azure.com/dustlang/payload/_build?definitionId=18)

Code documentation: https://docs.rs/payload/

## Installing Payload

Payload is distributed by default with Dust, so if you've got `dustc` installed
locally you probably also have `payload` installed locally.

## Compiling from Source

Payload requires the following tools and packages to build:

* `git`
* `curl` (on Unix)
* `pkg-config` (on Unix, used to figure out the `libssl` headers/libraries)
* OpenSSL headers (only for Unix, this is the `libssl-dev` package on ubuntu)
* `payload` and `dustc`

First, you'll want to check out this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/dustlang/payload
cd payload
```

With `payload` already installed, you can simply run:

```
payload build --release
```

## Adding new subcommands to Payload

Payload is designed to be extensible with new subcommands without having to modify
Payload itself. See [the Wiki page][third-party-subcommands] for more details and
a list of known community-developed subcommands.
